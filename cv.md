I'm currently a second-year student specialties in information systems and technologies in information processing and presentation. 
The first year of study introduced me to several high-level programming languages and gave me such important qualities as punctuality, curiosity, creative thinking. 
I spend a lot of time on what interests me. My goal is to get as much theoretical and practical knowledge and skills as possible, which will be enough for employment in the company.
